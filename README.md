<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/comments-app-output-v0.gif" alt="comments output" style="max-width:70%;box-shadow:0 2.8px 2.2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)">

- When non-empty values are provided and **Add Comment** button is clicked,
  - A new comment should be added to the list of comments
  - The comments count should be incremented by one
  - The value of the input fields for name and comment should be updated to their initial values
- When the **Like** button of a comment is clicked, if the image for **Like** is
  - [Like](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/react-js/comments-app/like-img.png) image, then it should be changed to the [Liked](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/react-js/comments-app/liked-img.png) image
  - [Liked](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/react-js/comments-app/liked-img.png) image, then it should be changed to the [Like](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/react-js/comments-app/like-img.png) image
